# Iris-Softmax
A 'Softmax Regression' based model implemented on a Modified version of the [Iris Plant Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

The last attribute is changed to a numeric value to represent a class.
 as follows:
* Iris-setosa is replaced with `0`
* Iris-versicolor is replaced with `1`
* Iris-virginica is replaced with `2`

Rest all the attributes are the same.

The data is randomly split into 20% testing and 80% training set.
